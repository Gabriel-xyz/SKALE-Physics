A 2D **Arcade Physics Engine** for games, designed for massive simulation games like *Dwarf Fortress* or *Rimworld* needing many thousands of moving bodies at once. Built for speed, it prioritizes performance over realistic physics, enabling 50,000+ bodies at 60 FPS when running as a server. This screenshot is 30,000 static objects (ðŸŸ¥), 15,000 dynamic objects (9000 moving (ðŸŸ©) and 6000 only moving if collided against (ðŸŸ¦))

## Overview
SKALE Physics is made for a certain type of game requiring massive numbers of bodies, such as multiplayer or massive simulation games. It achieves unmatched performance by removing features simulation games rarely need, and using arcade-style physics rather than realistic simulations.

On a 2014 CPU (i5 4690K), in browser, it handles:
- **20,000 static boxes** (red) ðŸŸ¥
- **10,000 dynamic boxes** (5,000 moving (green) ðŸŸ©, 5,000 sleeping (blue) ðŸŸ¦)
- **60 FPS** in the browser, with even better performance on servers (rendering is the bottleneck).

## Features
SKALE Physics includes:

| Feature | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| **High Performance** | Fastest JavaScript physics engine, outperforming Box2D WASM, Matter.js, and Phaser Arcade Physics. |
| **Collision Detection** | AABB/Circle collisions only for maximum speed (no SAT). |
| **Layers** | Define which bodies collide with each other using collision and layer masks. |
| **Body Sleeping** | Optimizes performance by putting non-moving bodies to sleep. |
| **Triggers** | Support for trigger bodies. |
| **Optimized RBush** | Custom RBush implementation, 10% faster than standard. |
| **Broadphase Padding** | Significant optimization for collision detection. |
| **Physics Properties** | Mass, bounce, damping, velocity, acceleration, impulse. |
| **World Bounds** | Bodies can't leave the defined world boundaries. |
| **Wall Sliding** | Smooth sliding along walls. |
| **Data-Oriented Design** | Optimized for speed with minimal overhead. |
| **Multithreading** | Each map can have its own "Physics World" on a separate thread for multiplayer games. |
| **Body Interactions** | Bodies can push or impart forces on each other. |

## Missing Features
The library is in alpha and lacks three features for completion (funding needed):
- Raycasting
- Circle Colliders
- Collision/Trigger Callbacks

It works great for games that donâ€™t require these features, but being in alpha it could use a more comprehensive API.

## Performance
SKALE Physics is designed for:
- **Massive simulation games** needing many thousands of bodies (e.g., *Dwarf Fortress*, *Rimworld*).
- **Multiplayer games** requiring very high NPC/player counts across many maps (multithreaded physics worlds per map).
- **Browser or server** environments, with superior performance on servers due to browser rendering bottlenecks.

It sacrifices features like joints, constraints, stable stacking, and compound colliders for speed, as these are rarely used in the type of massive simulation games this physics engine was made for.

## Use Cases
- **Massive Simulation Games**: Optimized for large-scale simulations with many dynamic bodies.
- **Multiplayer Games**: Supports massive player/NPC counts with multithreaded physics worlds.
- **Top-Down RPGs**: In a way this library is as if you wanted 2D RPG movement in your game then decided you wanted basic physics too.

## Benchmarks
| Environment | Static Bodies | Dynamic Bodies | FPS | Hardware |
|-------------|---------------|----------------|-----|----------|
| **Server**  | 0             | 20,000 (12,000 moving, 8,000 sleeping) | 62  | i5 4690K (2014) |
| **Browser** | 20,000        | 10,000 (6,000 moving, 4,000 sleeping) | 60  | i5 4690K (2014) |

## Why SKALE Physics?
- **Outperforms competitors**: Beats Box2D WASM, Matter.js, and Phaser Arcade Physics in speed.
- **Arcade-focused**: Purpose built for games, not realistic physics simulations.
- **Scalable**: Handles thousands of bodies, perfect for large-scale or multiplayer games with many maps.
- **Lightweight**: Optimized for both browser and server, with server-side performance excelling greatly.
